# minesweeper
 A recreation of the classic Minesweeper game
 
 # Gameplay
 If the game is missing any features, let me know!
 * Chord: To chord, use the *middle mouse button* over a hint cell after placing a flag on all suspected bombs in a given 3x3 grid to automatically unveil cells quickly.
 * Flagging: Right click on a cell to toggle between flagged and questioned
 * Exiting: You can click on the little red x on the window itself to exit :)
 * Random generation: Like the original Minesweeper, the location of the bombs will be different every game. You will never fail on your first click.
 * Levels: The game cycles through Beginner, Intermediate, then Expert. The Expert level will repeat once completed. Click on the smiley face to reset the game or advance to the next level
